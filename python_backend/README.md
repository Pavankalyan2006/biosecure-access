# BioSecure Python Backend

This is a Flask-based backend for the BioSecure application that processes biometric data for authentication.

## Setup Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed

2. Install the required packages:
```
pip install flask flask-cors
```

3. Run the application:
```
python app.py
```

The server will start on http://localhost:5000

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/validate-credentials` - Validates user email and password
- `POST /api/biometric/fingerprint` - Processes fingerprint data
- `POST /api/biometric/heartbeat` - Processes heartbeat data
- `POST /api/biometric/dna` - Processes DNA data

## Next Steps for Production

For a production environment, you would want to:

1. Use a proper database for user storage
2. Implement secure password hashing
3. Add proper authentication tokens
4. Implement actual biometric processing libraries
5. Add HTTPS for secure communication
6. Deploy to a production server
